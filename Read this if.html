    <p>STOP BEING LAZY. Omg i'm so helpfull üòç
        <br>
        No but like seriously think about the feeling of achievement that you will get
        if you get out of your bed and be productive. Think about Elon Mousk, do you think 
        he became a billionaire by being lazy? I don't think so. So stop being lazy, laziness
        is the enemy of succes and success is our friend so the enemy of your friend must be 
        your enemy too. Go work, do your homework, revise your exams, workout, do fun things, 
        but stop doing nothing. YOU CAN DO IT. STOP BEING LAZYYY. </br>

<button class="accordion">‚òÖ Read this if you are feeling upset ‚òÖ</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>It's okay to be upset, mad, angry (do they mean the same thing? I don't know) but don't let
       those feellings ruin your day. You should think about how good it feels to be happy, think about 
       good memories or i don't know, think about people that make you happy. Just think happy. Forget whatever
       that made you feel like this and move on because life is way better when we don't give a fouk.
       If I made you upset, well then please please please don't be. Think about flowers and colors and 
       don't be upset.

<button class="accordion">‚òÖ Read this if you are feeling sad ‚òÖ</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Listen if you are feeling sad for whatever reason, know that it's okay but you should try feeling better, 
        try doing calm things (i don't knwo how to say it) like things that you like and that make you calm down and 
        erase the bad feellings you know. You can color things, draw, write, listen to music things like that.
        If you need to talk to someone you can always talk to me I will try my best to make you feel better.
        Smile and be happy you deserve that

<button class="accordion">‚òÖ Read this if you are feeling stressed ‚òÖ</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Why are you stressed? Stress doesn't exist. You are not stressed. This is just your imagination. Okay I probably
        stressed you even more. I just figured that gaslighting you was the best i can do. 
        You know what? You shouldn't stressed because you are you. And you shoudn't be stressed. Stress is for the loulou. Be strong!!
        Calm down and think about non-stressful things. Don't give a fouk about anything really. Lets live life without giving 
        a fouk.

<button class="accordion">‚òÖ Read this if you are feeling bored ‚òÖ</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Omg I have the perfect solution for you!! Text me and we can play games together! (Don't call me without saying anything
        it will scare me). There is a scientific proof that playing games with me is the ultimate solution to boredom. Soooo... what are you 
        waiting for? The monster of boredom to kidnap you? This is a very serious matter, hurry up before it's too late.
